# pyCRC Plot
A simple GUI tool to fit concentration response curves to the hill equation, calculate EC50s, and plot. The tool allows plotting several curves in one graph by defining which columns corresponde to each curve, otherwise it will plot an average of all the columns. The standard deviation of the curve is shown as a shaded translucent region.
